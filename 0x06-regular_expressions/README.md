A regular expression (regex or regexp) is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern, primarily used for string matching and manipulation. Regular expressions enable you to identify, extract, replace, or delete specific patterns within text. They are widely used in programming, text processing, and data validation due to their powerful and flexible syntax.

Key components of regular expressions include:

Literal Characters: Match exact characters (e.g., a, 1, @).
Metacharacters: Special characters that define the pattern (e.g., ., ^, $, *, +, ?, [], {}, ()).
Character Classes: Define a set of characters to match (e.g., [a-z] matches any lowercase letter).
Quantifiers: Specify how many times a character or group should be matched (e.g., * for 0 or more, + for 1 or more).
Anchors: Specify the position in the text (e.g., ^ for the start, $ for the end).
Groups and Alternation: Use parentheses for grouping and | for alternation (e.g., (cat|dog) matches "cat" or "dog").
Regular expressions are implemented in various programming languages and tools, each with slight variations in syntax and capabilities.
