0x0F. Load Balancer

A load balancer is a system that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed. This helps maximize application availability, improve performance, and increase reliability. In this task, you'll configure Nginx to add a custom HTTP response header, X-Served-By, which includes the hostname of the server handling the request. This allows you to track which server in the load-balanced setup is responding to client requests.
