a programming or software engineering curriculum that focuses on debugging issues within a web stack. A web stack typically includes the components required to run a web application, such as the server, database, and front-end and back-end frameworks.

Key Concepts
Debugging: Identifying and fixing errors or issues in the web stack components.
Web Stack Components: This may include web servers (like Apache or Nginx), databases (like MySQL or PostgreSQL), and application servers or environments (like Node.js, Ruby on Rails, or Django).
Tools and Techniques: Use of debugging tools, logging, monitoring, and diagnostic techniques to troubleshoot issues.
Objectives
Learn how to identify and resolve issues within various parts of the web stack.
Gain hands-on experience with debugging tools and methods.
Understand common problems and their solutions in web development environments.
This module would be critical for developing skills to maintain and optimize web applications effectively.
