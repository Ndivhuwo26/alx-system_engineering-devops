Processes and signals

Processes and signals are fundamental concepts in operating systems and computer science.

Processes:
A process can be thought of as an executing instance of a program. It's the basic unit of execution in an operating system. Each process has its own memory space, which includes the code being executed, the data associated with that code (variables, etc.), and a call stack that keeps track of function calls and returns. Processes also have other attributes like process ID (PID), priority, and state (running, ready, blocked, etc.).

When a program is executed, the operating system creates a process for it. Processes can interact with each other through inter-process communication mechanisms like pipes, sockets, and shared memory. Processes can also spawn other processes, which leads to a hierarchical structure where processes can have parent-child relationships.

Signals:
Signals are a form of asynchronous notification sent to a process by the operating system or another process. They are used to notify a process of an event that occurred. Signals can be generated by a variety of events such as user actions (like pressing Ctrl+C), hardware exceptions (like segmentation faults), or by other processes.

Signals can be handled by processes through signal handlers. When a signal is received, the corresponding signal handler is executed. Signal handlers can perform various actions like ignoring the signal, handling the signal (e.g., terminating the process gracefully), or performing custom actions.

Common signals include SIGINT (interrupt from keyboard, typically Ctrl+C), SIGSEGV (segmentation violation, accessing invalid memory), SIGTERM (termination request), and SIGKILL (forceful termination).

Processes and signals are crucial for managing the execution of programs in a multitasking environment, providing mechanisms for communication, synchronization, and error handling.
