0x0C. Web server

0x0C-web_server typically refers to a hexadecimal notation used in programming, where '0x0C' specifically represents the character code for a "form feed" in ASCII. However, in the context of web servers, it might imply a specific server configuration or setup related to hexadecimal representations, though without further context, it's not specific to a widely known web server software or technology.
